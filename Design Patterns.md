# Design Patterns

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems.

## Design patterns can be divided into 3 categories

1.  **Creational**

    1.  [Factory Method](#factory-method)

    2.  [Abstract Factory](#abstract-factory)

    3.  [Builder](#builder)

    4.  [Prototype](#prototype)

    5.  [Singleton](#singleton)

2.  **Structural**

    1.  [Adapter](#adapter)

    2.  [Bridge](#bridge)

    3.  [Composite](#composite)

    4.  [Decorator](#decorator)

    5.  [Facade](#facade)

    6.  [Flyweight](#flyweight)

    7.  [Proxy](#proxy)

3.  **Behavioral**

    1.  [Chain of Responsibility](#chain-of-responsibility)

    2.  [Command](#command)

    3.  [Interpreter](#interpreter)

    4.  [Iterator](#iterator)

    5.  [Mediator](#memento)

    6.  [Memento](#memento)

    7.  [Observer](#observer)

    8.  [Visitor](#visitor)

    9.  [Strategy](#strategy)

    10. [State](#state)

    11. Template Method

## Creational

*These patterns deal mainly with creation of objects and classes. These deal
with object construction and referencing.*

#### Factory Method

#### Abstract Factory

#### Builder

#### Prototype

#### Singleton

## Structural

*These patterns deal with Class and Object Composition. These deal with the
relationships between objects and how they interact with each other to form
larger complex objects.*

### Adapter

### Bridge

### Composite

### Decorator

### Facade

### Flyweight

### Proxy

## Behavioral

*These mainly deals with Class - Object communication. That means they are
concerned with the communication between class and objects. These deal with the
communication between objects, especially in terms of responsibility and
algorithms.*

### Chain of Responsibility

### Command

### Interpreter

### Iterator

### Mediator

### Memento

### Observer

### Visitor

### Strategy

### State

### Template Method
