# Design Patterns - C\# GoF Design Patterns Implementation

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems or help you solve
commonly-occurring problems in software design

## Design patterns can be divided into 3 categories

-   [Creational](#creational)

-   [Structural](#structural)

-   [Behavioral](#behavioral)

### Creational

1.  [Factory Method](#factory-method)

2.  [Abstract Factory](#abstract-factory)

3.  [Builder](#builder)

4.  [Prototype](#prototype)

5.  [Singleton](#singleton)

### Structural

1.  [Adapter](#adapter)

2.  [Bridge](#bridge)

3.  [Composite](#composite)

4.  [Decorator](#decorator)

5.  [Facade](#facade)

6.  [Flyweight](#flyweight)

7.  [Proxy](#proxy)

### Behavioral

1.  [Chain of Responsibility](#chain-of-responsibility)

2.  [Command](#command)

3.  [Interpreter](#interpreter)

4.  [Iterator](#iterator)

5.  [Mediator](#memento)

6.  [Memento](#memento)

7.  [Observer](#observer)

8.  [Visitor](#visitor)

9.  [Strategy](#strategy)

10. [State](#state)

11. [Template Method](#template-method)

## Creational

*These patterns deal mainly with creation of objects and classes. These deal
with object construction and referencing.*

### Factory Method

Factory Method also known as Virtual Constructor, Creates an instance of several
derived classes

#### Wiki Definition

The [factory method
pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) is a [creational
pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern) that uses factory
methods to deal with the problem of [creating
objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_creation) without having to
specify the
exact [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) of the
object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a
factory method—either specified in
an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(object-oriented_programming)) and
implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally
overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling
a [constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)).

#### User Case

### Abstract Factory

### Builder

### Prototype

### Singleton

## Structural

*These patterns deal with Class and Object Composition. These deal with the
relationships between objects and how they interact with each other to form
larger complex objects.*

### Adapter

### Bridge

### Composite

### Decorator

### Facade

### Flyweight

### Proxy

## Behavioral

*These mainly deals with Class - Object communication. That means they are
concerned with the communication between class and objects. These deal with the
communication between objects, especially in terms of responsibility and
algorithms.*

### Chain of Responsibility

### Command

### Interpreter

### Iterator

### Mediator

### Memento

### Observer

### Visitor

### Strategy

### State

### Template Method
