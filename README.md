# Design Patterns

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems.

## Design patterns can be divided into 3 categories

1.  **Creational**

    1.  [Factory Method](#factory-method)

    2.  [Abstract Factory](#abstract-factory)

    3.  [Builder](#builder)

    4.  [Prototype](#prototype)

    5.  [Singleton](#singleton)

2.  **Structural**

    1.  Adapter

    2.  Bridge

    3.  Composite

    4.  Decorator

    5.  Facade

    6.  Flyweight

    7.  Proxy

3.  **Behavioral**

    1.  Chain of Responsibility

    2.  Command

    3.  Interpreter

    4.  Iterator

    5.  Mediator

    6.  Memento

    7.  Observer

    8.  Visitor

    9.  Strategy

    10. State

    11. Template Method

## Creational

## *These patterns deal mainly with creation of objects and classes.* These deal with object construction and referencing.

#### Factory Method

#### Abstract Factory

#### Builder

#### Prototype

#### Singleton

## Structural

## *These patterns deal with Class and Object Composition.* These deal with the relationships between objects and how they interact with each other to form larger complex objects.

### Adapter

### Bridge

### Composite

### Decorator

### Facade

### Flyweight

### Proxy

## Behavioral

## *These mainly deals with Class - Object communication. That means they are concerned with the communication between class and objects. T*hese deal with the communication between objects, especially in terms of responsibility and algorithms.

### Chain of Responsibility

### Command

### Interpreter

### Iterator

### Mediator

### Memento

### Observer

### Visitor

### Strategy

### State

### Template Method
